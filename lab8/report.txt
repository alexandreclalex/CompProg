Airport Coffee
    Document what the problem is asking for in your own words
        A person is attempting to walk through the airport to get to their gate, along the way they stop for coffee which increased their speed.
        Given the distance they need to walk, the speed they walk at with and without coffee, the time it takes before drinking and the time it takes to drink.
        Find when the person should stop for coffee at the given coffee shops along the way.

    Describe the algorithm and data structure you used to solve (or attempt to solve) the problem
       I used a while loop to increment when the person should stop to drink the coffee and then increment the total distance by how far the person has traveled.
       This runs into the issue of iterating through too many times since the distance can be over 10^11 but the person moves only 135 cm per iteration.

    What is the runtime complexity and memory complexity of your solution?
        Since you are iterating through the distances
        Time complexity: O(n)

        To store the cart locations requires O(n) memory.
        Memory complexity:O(n)

    What optimizations (if any) did you implement?
        Trying to find the next closest cart is tricky that I(David) was unable to solve. Also to avoid iterating through the while loop will help as well. Maybe
        there is another way to go around this.
    How did other programming languages (if used) affect your submission results?
        We did not attempt other languages.
