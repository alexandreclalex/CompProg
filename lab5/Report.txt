Bachet's Game
    Document what the problem is asking for in your own words
        Bachets game is a game of removal of pieces. Whoever removes the last piece is the winner. Given a number of pieces, and a number of valid moves, predict who wins

    Describe the algorithm and data structure you used to solve (or attempt to solve) the problem
        We used an array based approach marking whether p1 wins or loses.
        We iterate through the array, starting at 0. For each number:
            Assume we lose
            iterate through the possible moves, for each move:
                If we are one move away from a loss, we can force p2 to lose, i.e. win.

    What is the runtime complexity and memory complexity of your solution?
        n = number of test cases
        m = number of pieces in the test case
        Runtime: O(n*m)
            each of the n test cases requires iterating through the array up to m
        Memory: O(1)
            since we know that m cannot exceed 1,000,000, we use the same array for all cases of size 1,000,001

    What optimizations (if any) did you implement?
        By resuing the same array for all cases, we save on allocating an array every time

    How did other programming languages (if used) affect your submission results?
        Python was simply not fast enough for this problem, I rewrote it in C++, which was fast enough

Guessing Game
    Document what the problem is asking for in your own words
        Given the transcript from a guessing game, determine if the person giving the answers is being honest

    Describe the algorithm and data structure you used to solve (or attempt to solve) the problem
        iterate through the guesses, for each:
            set min to -1 and max to 11
            if the guess is "too low" or "too high":
                adjust the bounds of our possible valid numbers if the guess is less than min or greater than max
            if the guess is "right on", check that the last guess was within the bounds:
                if it is in bounds, he may be honest, otherwise he is lying

    What is the runtime complexity and memory complexity of your solution?
        n = number of guesses
        Runtime: O(n)
            Need to run checks on each guess
        Memory: O(1)
            We only have 2 variables, min and max

    What optimizations (if any) did you implement?
        By putting the guess qualifiers in a list, it was easier to program.
