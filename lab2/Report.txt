Odd A’s, Even B’s

    Document what the problem is asking for in your own words
        Given length n, how many strings of {a, b} can be made where a's are always in odd groups and b's are always in even groups

    Describe the algorithm and data structure you used to solve (or attempt to solve) the problem
        I used a recursive algorithm with a cache to speed up computation.
        If n = 0: we have reached the end of the string, and return 1
        If the result was already computed, return what we calculated before

        I implemented rules based on the last char, using the odd/even properties of 'a' and 'b' respectively:
            'a':
                Add 2 'a', and calculate n - 2
                Add 2 'b', and calculate n - 2
            'b':
                Add 1 'a', and calculate n - 1
                Add 2 'b', and calculate n - 2
            Start of String:
                Add 1 'a', and calculate n - 1
                Add 2 'b', and calculate n - 2
        
        I then cache the result in the cache, and return the result

    What is the runtime complexity and memory complexity of your solution?
        Runtime: O(n)
            Since we cache the result, and the time to calculate one cache entry is constant, we have the smae complexity for runtime as memory.
        Memory: O(n)
            With caching, we have at most n * 2 cache entries, one for each length and each last char.

    What optimizations (if any) did you implement?
        Adding a cache to the problem greatly improved the runtime, as the solution went from exponential recursion to linear recursion

    How did other programming languages (if used) affect your submission results?
        Python inbuit dict was useful as a quick and easy way to build a cache
