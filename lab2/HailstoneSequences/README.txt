Document what the problem is asking for in your own words
    Hailstone sequences is a simple problem where given an integer, depending on if it is even or odd, perform a certain calculation.
    After a few calculations, it will eventually become 1. When it reaches one, you are done and return how many calculations were done.

Describe the algorithm and data structure you used to solve (or attempt to solve) the problem
    We used a while loops to continue looping until we reach a base case of n = 1. Inside the while loop, we used an if-else
    statement to check if n is even or odd.
